How to describe packets. The important thing to realize is that each frame is just a subframe of the other type. I.e. 

Target applications: 
  * Soma Network Protocol
  * Soma Acqboard Fiber I/O 
  * DSP/FPGA interface
  * Event bus per-byte layout
  * Unix Domain Socket Protocol


What I'd like to be able to do is say:
Things to note: 
    for a frame definition:
    id = unique field-valid ID for that field
    name = name to be printed
    info = info about the filed
    valset = set of options for the field, and explanations
    wordlen = nominal number of bits in a word; shows the expected width of the data stream. For most things, this is 8 bits (1 byte) but we have numerous double-byte-wide protocols. 

    bits = subfield bits in use:
        remainder = remainder of bits in the field
    num: means that the subfield contained within can have multiple copies of itself. 
    endian = "l" == little bit first
    
    Frames can contain fields, which can contain frames,     

How do I represent a length of n short little-endian ints? 
    <field bits="16" id="valArray" num="n">
       <name> Value Array </name>
       <info> My array of short ints </info>
    </field>

How do I represent a length of m copies of a subframe:
    <field id="myTypeArray" num="m">
      <name>channel data array </name>
      <info> 1 to 4 of the following channel types>
      <frame> 
         ...
      </frame>
    </field>



<frame len="25" wordlen="8">
    <name>Acqboard TX</name>
    <field bits="8" id="k">
         <name>K.28.5</name>
         <info>8b/10b comma character which specifies frame start </info>
    </field>
    <field bits="8" id="cmdst">
         <name>CMDST</name>
         <info>Current command status of the acquisition board<info>
	    <valset value="0x00"> Mode 0 (normal) running</valset>
	    <valset value="0x01"> Mode 0 (normal) loading</valset>
	    <valset value="0x02"> Mode 1 (offset disable) running</valset>
	    <valset value="0x03"> Mode 1 (offset disable) loading</valset>
	 </info>    
    </field>
    <field bits="16" id="data-a1" endian=">
	   <name>DATA A1</data>
	   <info>16-bit twos-complement sample from channel A1</info>
    </field>
    ... 
</frame>
