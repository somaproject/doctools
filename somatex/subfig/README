Manifest and Documentation for the `subfig' package (version 1.3).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains version 1.3 of the subfig package.  In a UNIX
or UNIX-like command shell, use `make' to extract the subfig package
and run the local tests.

NOTES:
------

1. To verify the results of the test(s) (which are run using the
   preferred options), compare with the test(s) found at:
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sdc/latex/subfig.13/

2. This version of the subfig package removes a "feature" which
   allowed a line break to occur between two subfloats separated
   by whitespace instead of requiring an explicit "\\".  If this
   "feature" was used to position sub-floats, they may now be
   incorrectly displayed.

   If this occurs, the solution is to add an expicit linebreak
   between the problem sub-floats.  For example, the following
   to the left would seem to work correctly, but suppressed
   the "farskip" placing the figures too close together and 
   will, now, no longer work.  It should be written as on the
   left.
