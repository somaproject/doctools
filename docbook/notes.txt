gentle guide to docbook:

http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-docbk.html

Docbook extensions I want to add or create :

<signaldef set="EventBus"> a list of signal definitions, or something. This will also be usable for the VHDL fu.
    <signal active="low" type="clock"> 
           <name>FOO</name>
	   <info>bar baz foo</>
    </signal>
</signaldef>

outside of a signal def, we can just reference it with <signal set="EventBus">FOO</signal>

We can use the xslt identity transform along with some custom code to essentially


for FOP:
fop -xml test.xml -xsl  /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/fo/docbook.xsl -pdf test2.pdf

Additions to docbook that we've made:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<addr> is an address, gets turned into <filename>

<memmap title="foobarr">
   <addr a="0x0000"> Bar </addr>
   <addr a="lala-lama"> </addr>
</memmap>


For math:
   <math>foobar</math> for inline math
   <eqn> 
	 for equation-like objects
   </eqn>




So, what is our toolchain flow?

From our original documnet:

1. extract out timing diagrams, turn them into svg files, turn those into .eps, .png
2. Turn timing media object into associated image media objects

3. run through hardware.xsl:
    Handles <signal>
	    <memmap>, 
    turning them into native docbook

4. Math: how to handle it:
   1. print output: resulting docbook + math stuff will be turned into tex by our to-tex conversion code
   2. HTML output: create images, use them inline, etc. 




How to handle interfacing with vhdl & design documents? 
    How to crop out unnecessary stuff? Viewports? 
    Obviously we need one document per figure.
